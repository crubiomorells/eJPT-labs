# Lab 04 - Vulnerability Assessment CTF 

This lab focused on enumerating web services using **Nessus** and manual
inspection of directories. Four flags were hidden in exposed
directories, misconfigured phpMyAdmin, a Git repository, and a phpinfo
file.

## Flag 1 - Git repository disclosure

**Hint:** *Sometimes developers leave their version control systems
exposed. A `.git` folder can reveal more than intended.*

The initial Nessus scan reported:

-   **Plugin #65702 - Git Repository Served by Web Server**

Testing direct access confirmed the issue:

``` bash
curl http://target.ine.local/.git/
```

Inside the repository, a `flag.txt` file was discovered, revealing
**Flag 1**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Flag 2 - Misconfigured phpMyAdmin without password protection

**Hint:** *phpMyAdmin is often left exposed, sometimes even without
credentials.*

Nessus flagged:

-   **phpMyAdmin Installation Not Password Protected**

Navigating to the identified path showed that phpMyAdmin was accessible
without authentication. Exploring the databases, a table named
`secret_info` was found. Querying it revealed **Flag 2**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Flag 3 - phpinfo file disclosure

**Hint:** *A phpinfo file can leak sensitive system details if left
behind.*

Nessus also detected:

-   **Plugin #11229 - Web Server info.php / phpinfo.php Detection**

Accessing the file directly confirmed its presence:

``` bash
curl http://target.ine.local/phpinfo.php
```

Among the PHP configuration details, **Flag 3** was clearly embedded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Flag 4 - Exposed passwords directory

**Hint:** *Directory indexing may expose more than intended. Check for
interesting folders.*

The Nessus scan showed:

-   **Browsable Web Directories**, including `/passwords/`.

This path was also listed in `robots.txt`:

``` bash
curl http://target.ine.local/robots.txt
```

Navigating to `/passwords/` revealed a `flag.txt` file containing **Flag
4**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary

1.  **Nessus scanning** identified several critical misconfigurations
    (`phpinfo.php`, exposed Git, phpMyAdmin without password, and
    browsable directories).\
2.  **Manual browsing** confirmed the exposed `.git` folder and
    retrieved the first flag.\
3.  **phpMyAdmin** with no authentication allowed direct database access
    and revealed the second flag.\
4.  **phpinfo.php** disclosed sensitive system information and the third
    flag.\
5.  **robots.txt + directory listing** led to `/passwords/`, where the
    fourth flag was located.

This lab demonstrated how automated scanning tools like Nessus highlight
potential entry points, but manual followâ€‘up and exploration are
essential to actually retrieve sensitive information and hidden flags.

## Tools Used

-   **Nessus** - vulnerability scanning and misconfiguration detection\
-   **curl** - HTTP requests and quick content retrieval\
-   **Browser** - manual inspection of exposed web directories\
-   **phpMyAdmin** - direct database interaction through
    misconfiguration
